#  E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in an e-commerce environment, aiming to uncover actionable insights that improve customer retention using data science techniques.

---

## Objective

To predict customer churn by performing in-depth data exploration, feature engineering, class balancing, and machine learning modeling.

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visual exploration with distribution plots, boxplots, and heatmaps  
   - Comparison of churned vs. retained customers using statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-Square, Cramér’s V)

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removal of missing values and duplicates  
   - Label encoding for categorical features  
   - Multicollinearity check using VIF

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Derived features: `PriceToQuantity`, `AvgItemValue`, `AgeGroup`, `PurchaseMonth`  
   - Normalization and transformations for modeling readiness

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**  
   - Applied ADASYN to oversample minority (churned) class

5. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression (baseline & with ADASYN)  
   - XGBoost with `scale_pos_weight`  
   - Evaluation metrics: ROC AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

6. **Model Explainability**  
   - SHAP analysis to interpret XGBoost model predictions and identify influential features
